    Grrrrr, you\u2019re not with Minnie, are you? We\u2019re the Wolfsong clan, we
    roam the playground's wild boundaries. As long as you\u2019re not friends with
    Minnie, you\u2019re alright with us. She spreads mean rumors about us, but she\u2019s
    not even very smart. I saw her hide her math quiz when she found out she failed\u2026
    Alright, pack, back to patrol!  "
