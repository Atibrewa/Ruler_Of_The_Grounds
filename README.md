Welcome to Westwood Elementary! 
It’s your first day of third grade and you’re excited to enjoy everything school has to offer, but most of all, that glorious time of day when you can forget about your classes and just be a kid: Recess.

But at Westwood Elementary, recess is no laughing matter. Bullies rule their domains with iron fists, and they only allow a select few to play where they wish. Atop the lofty heights of the play structure’s tallest tower, one bully stands above the rest: 
The Emperor (Jeff). 
 
If you want the freedom to enjoy your recess in peace, you’ll have to fight for it. But be careful, this is elementary school and reputation is everything. If you fail, you could become a complete outcast, doomed to spend recess with the teacher. So hone your skills in the classroom and vanquish the recess tyrants. 

Will you be the savior of the playground, or will you take the throne for yourself? 

The choice is yours, and recess has just begun.
